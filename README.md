# MAPPING-THE-RHYTHMS-OF-SEISMIC-STORIES
"Mapping the Rhythms of Seismic Stories" utilizes Tableau to examine earthquake trends, pinpointing seismic hotspots and risk patterns to enhance disaster preparedness. These insights aid decision-making in urban planning, emergency response, and infrastructure resilience.
This project leverages Tableau for data visualization and analysis to derive meaningful insights from a dataset. The primary objective is to transform raw data into actionable intelligence through interactive dashboards, charts, and reports. The project follows a structured approach, including data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, ensuring accuracy and clarity in representation. Various key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends are analyzed to provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset. The findings are presented in an intuitive manner, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions. The project also explores advanced Tableau functionalities such as calculated fields, filters, and parameter controls to enhance interactivity and user experience. Through this initiative, the team demonstrates proficiency in data analytics and visualization, making complex data more accessible and insightful.
